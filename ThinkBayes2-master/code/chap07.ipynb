    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter introduces three new distributions, so it can be hard to keep them straight.\n",
    "Let's review:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If a system satisfies the assumptions of a Poisson model, the number of events in a period of time follows a Poisson distribution, which is a discrete distribution with integer quantities from 0 to infinity. In practice, we can usually ignore low-probability quantities above a finite limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Also under the Poisson model, the interval between events follows an exponential distribution, which is a continuous distribution with quantities from 0 to infinity. Because it is continuous, it is described by a probability density function (PDF) rather than a probability mass function (PMF). But when we use an exponential distribution to compute the likelihood of the data, we can treat densities as unnormalized probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The Poisson and exponential distributions are parameterized by an event rate, denoted $\\lambda$ or `lam`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For the prior distribution of $\\lambda$, I used a gamma distribution, which is a continuous distribution with quantities from 0 to infinity, but I approximated it with a discrete, bounded PMF. The gamma distribution has one parameter, denoted $\\alpha$ or `alpha`, which is also its mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose the gamma distribution because the shape is consistent with our background knowledge about goal-scoring rates.\n",
    "There are many other distributions we could have used; however, we will see in Chapter XX that the gamma distribution can be a particularly good choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "But we have a few things to do before we get there, starting with these exercises."
