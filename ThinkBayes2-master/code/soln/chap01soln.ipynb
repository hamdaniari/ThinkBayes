    "A probability is a number between 0 and 1 (including both) that\n",
    "represents a degree of belief in a fact or prediction. The value 1\n",
    "represents certainty that a fact is true, or that a prediction will come\n",

    "Intermediate values represent degrees of certainty. The value 0.5, often\n",

    "## Conditional probability\n",
    "\n",
    "A conditional probability is a probability based on some relevant\n",
    "information. For example, suppose I toss two coins. The probability that\n",
    "both coins land heads is 25%.\n",
    "\n",
    "But suppose I toss two coins and, without showing you the result, tell\n",
    "you that at least one of the coins is heads. What is the probability\n",
    "that both are heads? The answer is 1/3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how I got that: when I toss the coins, there are four equally\n",
    "likely outcomes: heads-heads, heads-tails, tails-heads, and tails-tails.\n",
    "When I tell you that at least one coin is heads, that eliminates one\n",
    "outcome, tails-tails.\n",
    "\n",
    "The remaining outcomes are heads-heads, heads-tails, and tails-heads,\n",
    "and they are still equally likely. So the probability of heads-heads is\n",
    "1/3.\n",
    "\n",
    "That argument is correct, but if you don't find it entirely convincing,\n",
    "we'll come back to this problem and solve it more carefully using\n",
    "Bayes's Theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we computed the conditional probability of two heads,\n",
    "given the information that at least one coin is heads.\n",
    "\n",
    "The usual notation for conditional probability is $P(A|B)$, which is\n",
    "the probability of $A$ given that $B$ is true. In this example, $A$\n",
    "represents the two heads outcome, and $B$ is the condition that at least one\n",

    "## Conjoint probability\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conjoint probability** is a fancy way to say the probability that two\n",
    "things are true. I'll use the notation $P(A~\\mathrm{AND}~B)$ to mean the\n",
    "probability that $A$ and $B$ are both true.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you learned about probability in the context of coin tosses and dice,\n",
    "you might have learned the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(A~\\mathrm{AND}~B) = P(A)~P(B)$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if I toss two coins, and $A$ means the first coin lands\n",

    "\n",
    "$P(A~\\mathrm{AND}~B) = P(A)~P(B) = 0.25$.\n",
    "\n",
    "But this formula only works because in this case $A$ and $B$ are\n",
    "independent; that is, knowing the first outcome does not change the\n",
    "probability of the second. Or, more formally $P(A|B) = P(A)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a different example where the outcomes are not independent.\n",
    "Suppose that $A$ means that it rains today and $B$ means that it rains\n",

    "## Bayes's theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how we derive Bayes's theorem. We'll start with the probability\n",
    "of a conjunction: \n",
    "\n",
    "$P(A~\\mathrm{AND}~B) = P(A)~P(B|A)$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Since we have not\n",
    "said anything about what $A$ and $B$ mean, they are interchangeable.\n",
    "Interchanging them yields \n",
    "\n",
    "$P(B~\\mathrm{AND}~A) = P(B)~P(A|B)$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Also,\n",
    "conjunction is commutative; that is \n",
    "\n",
    "$P(A~\\mathrm{AND}~B) = P(B~\\mathrm{AND}~A)$\n",
    "\n",
    "That's all we need. Pulling those pieces together, we get\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(B)~P(A|B) = P(A)~P(B|A)$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Which means there are two ways to\n",
    "compute the conjunction. If you have $P(A)$, you multiply by the\n",
    "conditional probability $P(B|A)$. Or you can do it the other way\n",
    "around; if you know , you multiply by $P(A|B)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally we divide through by $P(B)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A)~P(B|A)}{P(B))$ \n",
    "\n",
    "And that's Bayes's theorem! It\n",
    "might not look like much, but it turns out to be surprisingly powerful.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we can use it to solve the cookie problem. I'll write $B_1$\n",
    "for the hypothesis that the cookie came from Bowl 1 and $V$ for the\n",
    "vanilla cookie. Plugging in Bayes's theorem we get\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(B_1|V) = \\frac{P(B_1)~P(V|B_1)}{P(V)})$ \n",
    "\n",
    "The term on the left is\n",
    "what we want: the probability of Bowl 1, given that we chose a vanilla\n",
    "cookie. The terms on the right are:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   $P(B_1)$: This is the probability that we chose Bowl 1,\n",
    "    unconditioned by what kind of cookie we got. Since the problem says\n",
    "    we chose a bowl at random, we can assume $P(B_1) = 1/2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   $P(V|B_1)$: This is the probability of getting a vanilla cookie\n",
    "    from Bowl 1, which is 3/4.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   $P(V)$: This is the probability of drawing a vanilla cookie from\n",
    "    either bowl. Since we had an equal chance of choosing either bowl\n",
    "    and the bowls contain the same number of cookies, we had the same\n",
    "    chance of choosing any cookie. Between the two bowls there are 50\n",
    "    vanilla and 30 chocolate cookies, so $P(V) = 5/8$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting it together, we have $P(B_1|V) = \\frac{(1/2)~(3/4)}{5/8}$\n",
    "which reduces to 3/5. So the vanilla cookie is evidence in favor of the\n",
    "hypothesis that we chose Bowl 1, because vanilla cookies are more likely\n",
    "to come from Bowl 1."

    "The Monty Hall problem is based on one of the regular games on the show.\n",
    "If you are a contestant, here's how the game works:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Monty shows you three closed doors numbered 1, 2, and 3. He tells\n",
    "    you that there is a prize behind each door.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   One prize is valuable (traditionally a car), the other two are less\n",
    "    valuable (traditionally goats).\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The object of the game is to guess which door has the car. If you\n",
    "    guess right, you get to keep the car.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you pick Door 1. Before opening the door you chose, Monty opens\n",
    "Door 3 and reveals a goat. Then Monty offers you the option to stick\n",
    "with your original choice or switch to the remaining unopened door.\n",
    "\n",
    "To maximize your chance of winning the car, should you stick with Door 1\n",
    "or switch to Door 2?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this question, we have to make some assumptions about the\n",
    "behavior of the host:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Monty always opens a door and offers you the option to switch.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  He never opens the door you picked or the door with the car.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  If you choose the door with the car, he chooses one of the other\n",
    "    doors at random.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under these assumptions, you are better off switching. If you stick, you\n",
    "win $1/3$ of the time. If you switch, you win $2/3$ of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have not encountered this problem before, you might find the\n",
    "answer surprising. You would not be alone; many people have the strong\n",
    "intuition that it doesn't matter if you stick or switch. There are two\n",
    "doors left, they reason, so the chance that the car is behind Door A is\n",
    "50%. But that is wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see why, it might help to use a Bayes table. We start with three\n",
    "hypotheses: the car might be behind Door 1, 2, or 3. According to the\n",
    "statement of the problem, the prior probability for each door is 1/3.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is that Monty opened Door 3 and revealed a goat. So let's\n",
    "consider the probability of the data under each hypothesis:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   If the car were behind Door 3, Monty would not have opened it, so\n",

    "\n",
    "-   If the car were behind Door 1, Monty would choose Door 2 or 3 at\n",
    "    random; the probability he would open Door 3 is $1/2$.\n",
