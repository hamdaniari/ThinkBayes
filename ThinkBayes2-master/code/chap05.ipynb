    "Out of 35 subjects, 12 correctly identified the gluten flour based on\n",
    "resumption of symptoms while they were eating it. Another 17 wrongly\n",
    "identified the gluten-free flour based on their symptoms, and 6 were\n",
    "unable to distinguish.\n",

    "This conclusion seems odd to me, because if none of the patients were\n",
